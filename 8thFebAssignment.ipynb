    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the ability to focus on the essential features of an object while ignoring the details that are not relevant to its current purpose. Abstraction allows for the creation of simpler, more manageable systems that can be easily modified and extended.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of abstraction can be seen in a car. When we use a car, we don't need to know how the engine works or how the transmission is shifting gears. Instead, we only need to know how to operate the steering wheel, pedals, and gear lever to control the car's movements. In this case, the car's internal workings are abstracted away from the user, allowing them to focus only on the essential features that they need to control.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction is often achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and are used as templates for other classes to inherit from. Interfaces define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface, allowing for a standardized way of interacting with different objects. Both of these techniques allow for the abstraction of complex details and the creation of more manageable, modular code."
